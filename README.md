This is a simle example of how you can use knockout with jade runtime templates and amd(require.js).

Inside templates you can use both ko binding system and jade's facilities.

At this point there is no automatic template loading.
You should require all needed templates manually before using them in ko template bindings.

todo: require templates on the fly (like: http://jsfiddle.net/rniemeyer/MKFj6/)
